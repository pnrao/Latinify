There are various languages across the world that are incomprehensible to most people mainly because of the script they are written in. For example, to a person familiar with conversational Hindi, Devanagari text might be incomprehensible. This Chrome extension aims to lower this barrier to entry.

This chrome extension takes the largest span of text in an indic language, and replaces it with its ITRANS equivalent.
